# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

This project was undertaken to produce an interactive map that vividly displays parts of the world pron to earthquakes and information on earthquakes recorded within the last 7 days.
Spacial data from the US Geological Survey was retrived to produce 3 major layers for the map.
The three layers dipicting earthquake information were namely;
- The All Earthquakes layer
- The Major Earthquakes layer and 
- The techtonic plates layer.
A control was introduced on the map to help users toggle between the relevant layers to generate the required image of the map. 

Below are examples of the map based on each layer.
